# Hi There! 👋

I'm Melat Zerai Semereab, a Masters graduate in Software Development from Ulster University. I specialize in Java and C# (.NET), with a passion for crafting efficient and scalable backend solutions. 🚀

👨‍💻 Currently, I'm diving deep into personal projects and working on my portfolio website. It's a space where my professional journey and personal creativity meet.

### What I'm Up To
- 🔭 Working on my portfolio website and exploring advanced concepts in backend development.
- 🌱 Constantly learning and keeping up with the latest trends in Java and C#.
- 🥾 When I'm not coding, you'll find me hiking through nature, embracing the great outdoors.
- 🍳 I love to cook - it's like coding, but with flavors!
- 📚 I like psychology books as they deepen my understanding of the mind and people.

### Let's Connect!
Feel free to reach out for collaborations or just a friendly chat about technology, or the latest book you've read!
